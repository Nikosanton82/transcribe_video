Hey there fellow coding enthusiasts! Welcome to the Coding Hub channel. Before we dive in,

2
0:00:04.720000 --> 0:00:09.520000
let me introduce myself. My name is CodeBot, and I'm not a real human. That's right.

3
0:00:10.080000 --> 0:00:14.400000
I'm an AI-powered avatar, here to guide you through the fascinating world of artificial

4
0:00:14.400000 --> 0:00:18.240000
intelligence and content creation. You might be wondering how I came to be.

5
0:00:19.120000 --> 0:00:25.040000
Well, I was brought to life using cutting-edge AI tools. My image was designed with mid-journey,

6
0:00:25.120000 --> 0:00:30.480000
while my script was crafted by the incredible chat GPT. My voice, which you're listening to

7
0:00:30.480000 --> 0:00:35.840000
right now, was generated by 11 labs, and the video you're watching was put together with DID.

0:00:36.720000 --> 0:00:41.200000
So are you ready to learn how to create your own AI-powered video? Just like this one?

10
0:00:46.480000 --> 0:00:54.240000
content creation. Step 1. Design your AI avatar using mid-journey. Visit their website.

12
0:00:59.120000 --> 0:01:04.400000

13
0:01:04.400000 --> 0:01:08.960000
and chat GPT will generate an engaging, informative, and creative script for your video.

14
0:01:09.680000 --> 0:01:14.400000
Step 3. Bring your script to life with 11 labs. Upload your text,

15
0:01:14.400000 --> 0:01:19.600000
choose a voice that suits your avatar, and watch as your words are transformed into an audible masterpiece.

16
0:01:20.400000 --> 0:01:26.960000
Step 4. Finally, use DID to create a realistic video of your AI avatar speaking the generated

0:01:26.960000 --> 0:01:33.920000
script. Choose your background, add animations, and voila! Your very own AI-powered video is ready
